    <p class="subtitle">Application of Aerial Photo Interpretation in Land Boundary Survey</p>
    <p class="paragraph1">There are various applications of aerial photo interpretation in land boundary survey in modern days, including:</p>
    <ul class="content">
    	<li>Boundary re-definition in Demarcation District (DD) Lots</li>
    	<li>DD sheets correlation (with the use of orthophotos)</li>
    	<li>Land dispute court cases</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p class="paragraph1">It is a common measure for surveyors to employ aerial photos of different years in re-establishing boundaries of old agricultural lots. The aerial photos could reveal the change of land use (if any) along the vicinity of the subject lot hence provide evidences for the boundary re-establishment.</p>
    <p class="paragraph1">Researches by Tang &amp; Guan (2010) and Zhang (2012) discussed different means of the creation of digital orthophotos using old aerial photos. Results showed that the use of digital orthophotos could provide a reasonable precise correlation of DD sheets.</p>
    <p class="paragraph1">The Chau Ka Chik Tso case [HCA 10670/2000, CACV 26/2010, and FACV 5/2011] in 2000 - 2011 is an example of interpreting aerial photos in land dispute court cases. Expert witnesses in the case presented aerial photos of various years (1924, 1945, 1956 etc.) together with plotted plans including DD control sheet and villagers' plan and old documentations in analyzing the occupation in the subject lot and it's vicinity. It was concluded that the dispute in the subject lot and the vicinity was due to encorachments instead of faulty records. And since the encroachment has passed the limitation period (60 years for government land), the plantiffs, i.e. tenants of the subject lot, extinguished the title of the landlord.</p>

    <p class="subtitle">Early Days</p>
	<p class="paragraph1">The first systematic aerial photography flights in Hong Kong were conducted by the Fleet Air Arm*, Royal Navy of the United Kingdom in 1924. Aerial photos from that survey project was extensively used for the production of 1:20,000 topographic maps. No further systematic flights were arranged since then until the second world war. There were both vertical and oblique images taken by the United States Air Force during WWII for reconnaissance and record purpose. </p>
	<p class="paragraph1">The Royal Air Force (UK) started regular aerial photography flights in 1945. </p>
	<p class="paragraph1">* Fleet Air Arm: The branch under the British Royal Navy. The FAA is responsible for the operation of the naval aircraft.</p>

    <p class="subtitle">1963 Aerial Survey</p>
    <p class="paragraph1">The 1963 aerial survey was      
    
    
    a systematic aerial survey which came after a decision to complete basic mapping of the New Territories by photogrammetric means. As described by Empson (1992): </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p class="paragraph1">A decision was taken in 1962 to complete basic mapping of the New Territories by aerial survey (photogrammetric) means. The British firm of Huntings Surveys Ltd was granted a contract to provide 1:1,200 mapping of the New Territories and 1:600 of the urban area.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p class="paragraph1">The survey was conducted under the joint effort of the Crown Lands and Survey Office (former state of the Lands Deparment). This complete survey did encountered difficulties in the planning stage as the geomorphology of the Hong Kong land was extreme. The situation was described by Dawe (1969) with a few sentences:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p class="paragraph1">Within its (Hong Kong) limited borders are to be found extremes of all kinds, from primitive agriculture to sophisticated industry, from simple barter to international banking and of more direct interest to surveyors, an almost complete range of terrain conditions, from flat, heavily cultivated areas in the north-west New Territories to foothills and massifs risings to above 3,000 feet in several cases, bare steep open hill sides, terraced paddy-land and highly developed urbdan and industrial areas, all of which are compressed into a total area of less then 300 square miles.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p class="paragraph1">The survey in 1963 ended with great success and the colonial government decided to carry out aerial surveys on their own. Since then, aerial surveys were carried out regularly.</p>

	<br />
    
    <p class="subtitle">Modern Days</p>
    <p class="paragraph1">The Survey and Mapping Office nowadays carry out aerial surveys regularly. Low altitude photography are taken at about 6 month intervals with coverage concentrated on urban areas including the Hong Kong Island, Kowloon and new towns. The Photogrammetric and Air Survey Section of the Survey and Mapping Office is responsible for maintaining the photogrammetric services and the aerial photos library.</p>

    <p class="subtitle">Photogrammetric Products Available in Suryey and Mapping Office</p>
    <p class="paragraph1">Phtoogrammetric products available in the Survey and Mapping Office include:</p>
    <ul class="content">
    	<li>Aerial photos in hard copy prints of various years</li>
    	<li>Enlargement copies of aerial photos</li>
    	<li>Digital aerial photos (DAP)</li>
    	<li>Digital orthophoto (DOP)</li>
    	<li>Photo book (Hong Kong Now and Then)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p class="subtitle">Aerial Photos in Hard Copy Prints and Enlargement of Photos</p>
    <p class="paragraph1">Photos are available from year 1924 to present, types can be classified into:</p>
    <ul class="content">
    	<li>Vertical &amp; Oblique</li>
    	<li>High level &amp; Low level</li>
    	<li>Black and white (B&amp;W) &amp; Colour</li>
    	<li>Infrared</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="paragraph1">In Hong Kong air photos taken with flying height less than 10,000 feet are referred to as 'Low Level' while 'High Level' is used for photographs taken at altitude more than 10,000 feet. Low Level flights plans are produced annually on transparencies of the 1:20,000 scale Hong Kong mapping while High Level flight lines are recorded on 1:100,000 scale maps (Ho, King & Wallace, 2006).</p>
    <p class="paragraph1">Aerial photos were all taken in B&amp;W film until the year 1972. Colour imagery were taken occasionally between the period 1972 and 1993 and regular flights were arranged since 1993. B&amp;W aerial photos are still taken by SMO in present days since this type of imagery is more effective in adverse weather conditions. </p>
    <p class="paragraph1">Aerial photo enlargement service is also available in SMO. 'Copies of these aerial photographs in the form of duplicate and enlargement are obtainable on order. The recommended enlargement ratio of most aerial photographs is up to 8 times depending on the quality of the image' (Survey and Mapping Office, 2015).</p>
	<br />
    
    <p class="subtitle">Digital Aerial Photos (DAP)</p>
    <p class="paragraph1">Digital aerial photos can be ordered directly by person from Map Sales Outlets by Survey and Mapping Office.There are two versions of aerial photos available, i.e. the DAP version with 1800dpi resolution and the lower quality DAP-L0 version. To be noted that is SMO does not provide the digital varsion of some aerial photos taken before 1963.</p>
    <br />
    
    <p class="subtitle">Digital Orthophoto (DOP)</p>
    <p class="paragraph1">There are 3 series of othrophoto available in the SMO, the DOP5000 series, DOP1000 series (also know as the 1963 orhtophoto), and the DOPM50-L0 series. The number suffix of these orthophoto series reveals the image resolution in terms of ground sampling distance per pixel.</p>
    <p class="paragraph1">The DOP5000 series has an image resolution of 0.5m in terms of ground sample distance per pixel covering the whole territory of Hong Kong (SMO, 2015). This series of othrophoto is supplied in the tile basis with coverage corresponding to a 1:5,000 topographic map. </p>
    <p class="paragraph1">The DOP1000 series orthophoto is a special edition provided by the SMO using aerial photos taken in 1963 hence it is also known as the 1963 orthophoto. It has an image resolution of 0.1m. One characteristic of this series of orthophoto is the images are georeferenced and corrdinates of specific points can be measured from the photo.  This series of orthophoto is supplied in the tile basis with coverage of each photo corresponding to a 1:1,000 survey plan.</p>
    <p class="paragraph1">The DOPM50-L0 series is an orthophoto series showing the whole Hong Kong territory in one single image with grid lines. The image resolution of this series is 5m. </p>
