    <p class="subtitle">The 1:1200 Mapping of The New Territories</p>
    <a href="image/1945/Old_Survey_Sheet.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="contentRight" src="image/1945/Old_Survey_Sheet.jpg" width="300px" style="border:1px solid #000" /></a>
    <p class="paragraph1">Because of intensive developments in the rural area and owing to the scale, geographic reference and content of the DD sheets, it was reckoned that the DD sheets could not meet the demand for land administration purposes which requires an efficient and updated record of the land parcels.</p>
    <p class="paragraph1">By early 1950's, a mapping exercise was commenced by the Public Works Department (PWD) for the NT and began to produce survey sheets at 1:1200 scale to replace the old DD sheets. The mapping was related to the territorial control network using plane table techniques. The mapping exercise also depicted field bunds of cultivation fields besides major mapping features but contours were omitted in the NT. The mapping exercise was completed at last using a full-scale photogrammetric survey method in 1963 (Huntings survey Ltd. of the United Kingdom was employed for the photogrammetric processing)<a href="image/1945/11_OSS.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="contentRight" src="image/1945/11_OSS.jpg" width="300px" style="border:1px solid #000; margin-right:0px;" /></a>.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A series of 1:1200 sheets was eventually produced by the late 1960s combining the detail fixed earlier by plane table with new detail and contours from the air survey. Areas above the 600 feet contour were not mapped until later. NGL were plotted on the 1:1200 series from this time and not on the DD sheets as in the past.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For areas covered with 1:1200 survey sheets, NTA began to process land disposals using survey sheets. Grant plan and records for NGL were entered into the available survey sheets on a need basis. Processes of OSL and old NGL were still carried out in DD scale.</p>
    <br />
    
    <p class="subtitle">Cadastral Survey Sheet (Cad-Survey sheet or Cad Sheet)</p>
    <p class="paragraph1">In 1958 the New Territories Administration (NTA) carried out a "Cadastral Survey", Correlation technique was introduced to interpret and transfer all available NT land boundary <a href="image/1945/Record_Sheet.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="contentRight" src="image/1945/Record_Sheet.jpg" width="300px" style="border:1px solid #000; margin-right:0px;" /></a>information, including DD sheets and HLP, onto the 1:1200 contemporary survey sheets. The processes include:</p>
    <ul class="content">
    	<li>'A' Sheets were marked with a large letter "A" at the top right corner. This represents the fair drawn sheets. Content shows mainly occupation. When the sheets were verified, amendments were entered into the errata sheets, remedial action would be suggested data than title.</li>
    	<li>'B' sheets were prepared by Crown Lands &amp; Survey Office (CL&amp;SO) with the letter &quot;B&quot; added before the sheet number at the bottom right hand corner. Vast majority of details has been omitted. Boundary drawn in black ink of various patter. Reliability and use similar to &quot;A&quot; sheets.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="paragraph1">Cad-Svy sheets have the work "Cadastral" above survey sheet not at bottom right corners prepared at transparency for verifying lot boundaries.</p>
    <p class="paragraph1">Although a land tribunal was suggested to be formed to resolve the boundary problems arisen from the Cadastral Survey, it has never been materialized, perhaps worrying about the consequence of disturbing the peaceful occupation. However, these Cad-Svy sheets are also internal Government records because no legal procedures had been taken for their adoption for use.</p>
    <br />
    
    <p class="subtitle">The Correlation</p>
    <p class="paragraph1">This stage applies to all sheets irrespective of existing 'A' Sheets ¡V which may be used for reference purposes only ¡V during the process of boundary correlation.</p>
    <dl class="content">
    	<dt>Correlating Enlarged DD and Survey Sheet</dt>
        <dd>Correlation will be carried out on Quarter Sheet transparencies in accordance with Drawing Office Instruction No. 11. Reference must always be made to district control sheets, records of previous correlation, plans attached to New Grant Register, Memorials etc. By the time, areas will be computed at this stage. All discrepancies found during correlation will be completed and attached to the relevant Quarter Sheet dyeline copy. When the Quarter Sheet transparencies have been prepared, they will be passed to the Land staff together with 2 dyeline copies and the Lot Record sheets for action (i.e. Field investigation).</dd>
        <dt>Field Investigation</dt>
        <dd>All doubtful and undefined boundaries marked blue required field checking. The boundaries that are agreed and accepted should be marked in Red on the dyeline copy. Where there is any doubt about the acceptability of a defined occupied boundary, it should be marked in green. None of the boundaries shown on the correlation transparency Quarter Sheets should be deleted or altered without permission from Cartographic staff.<br />When a boundary is defined on ground but not on the survey sheet, an entry will be made in ¡¥Lot Record Sheet¡¦ giving details of how the boundary is defined and plotted in green peck, on the dyeline Quarter Sheet. During field investigation it may be necessary for registered owners, Village Representatives and other interested parties to be consulted. Sufficient notice should be given to then regarding the date and time of visit. They should also be requested to bring any pertinent documents which would help to resolve the issue in question.<br />All decisions and agreements reached should be recorded in the appropriate column of Errata Sheet. When the field checking has been completed and all relevant information recorded, the quarter sheet transparency and dyeline copy together with the Lot Record Sheets will be returned to the Cartographic staff for the preparation of "Preliminary Cadastral Survey Sheet" and "Final Cadastral Survey Sheet".</dd>

    <p class="subtitle">Blue Keys and Green Keys</p>
    <p class="paragraph1">The Cadastral Survey stopped in the late 1960¡¦s and covered only a small portion of NT. The 1:1200 map series were converted to the metric scale of 1:1000 after the adoption of a metrication policy. Since 1976, another transfer to survey sheets of 1:1000 was required for metrication purposes. Later on, correlation was thus carried out on 1:1000 survey sheet, which formed the current correlation sheets. Without field verification, the correlated boundaries are of limited reliability and should be used for identification purposes. This revision also put less weight to features depicting occupational evidence. The results were fair drawn on Blue Keys. It was commented as being deviated from the logical interpretation of original boundaries.</p>
    <p class="paragraph1">Since 1983, when the Green Keys were introduced to replace the blue keys containing all permanent land holdings, the correlated boundaries was reviewed under a revised technical instruction.</p>
    <p class="paragraph1">For temporary land holdings, it is containing in the Black Keys.</p>
    <p class="paragraph1">The permanent land holding record contains no confidential items and could be available for public inspection. Being printable, its can used directly for reproduction of extracts for site plans. The base plan can be replaced by photomechanical process, and remained updated or maintained in good condition.</p>
    <p class="paragraph1">The temporary land and proposal record will contain all license, waivers, permits STT plus any proposal that are in processing. Since these items frequently change, there is no point in having a droppable base, rather the record will be replaced manually at reasonable intervals on new map base.</p>
