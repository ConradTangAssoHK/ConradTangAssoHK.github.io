	<p class="titleFont" style="font-style: italic;">Envolvement of Geodetic Datum</p>
    <br />
    
    <p class="subtitle">Early Geodetic Control in Hong Kong</p>
	<p class="paragraph1">With reference to the Explanatory Notes on Geodetic Datums in Hong Kong published by Survey and Mapping Office (SMO) in 1995, the triangulation stations first appeared on Hong Kong map produced in 1845 by Lt. Collinson R.E. A map was produced by Mr. Tate in 1899-1900 and another one was compiled by Mr. W.J. Newland in 1903-04. Although triangulation stations were shown on these maps, there was no survey record found for triangulation.</p>
    <br />
    
    <p class="subtitle">1924/25 Main Triangulation</p>
	<p class="paragraph1">In 1924-1925, a military map in a scale 1:20000 was produced from aerial photographs taken by the Royal Air Force with ground controls provided by the 2nd Colonial Survey Section R.E. These ground controls had been readjusted for more than 1 time, in 1928-1930 by Geographical Section, and later by the Crown Lands and Survey Office in 1946. It was adopted as the Main Triangulation of Hong Kong on which all surveys were based up to 1963.</p>
    <img class="contentRight" src="image/geodetic/HKM_O.bmp" />
    <p class="paragraph1"><font style="color:blue;font-weight:bold;">Base</font>: The line from Trig Partridge Hill (No. 2) to Channel Rock (No.3) was accepted as a based in accordance with the statement of the Survey Sub-department, P.W.D. that its length dependent on four previous bases was known with all necessary accuracy.</p>
    <p class="paragraph1"><font style="color:blue;text-decoration: underline;">"Cassini" Plane Rectangular Coordinates</font>: A system of plane rectangular coordinates had been used by the Crown Lands and Survey Office, Hong Kong for many years and was being used for all survey computations and plotting of large scale plans.</p>
    <p class="paragraph1">The zero origin for the plane rectangular coordinates was at Victoria Peak close to Trig Victoria Peak No.1 with a plane rectangular coordinate value of 5.18ft N and 0.38ft E. The working units of this coordinate system are in terms of feet. Four quadrants appeared which is known as the 'Old Imperial' coordinate system.</p>
    <br />
    
    <p class="subtitle">1963 Main Triangulation</p>
	<p class="paragraph1">A re-triangulation was carried out in 1963 because the network of that time could not meet the requirements for large-scale mapping and cadastral surveys.</p>
	<p class="paragraph1"><font style="color:blue;font-weight:bold;">Base</font>: The length of the line Trig Beacon Hill No. 5 to Trig Hai Wan No. 110 as determined by trigonometrical extension from the measured Kai Tak Base was provisionally adopted for computing the new plane rectangular coordinates. Subsequently, when three Tellurometer units became available, five long lines were measured with these instruments using main triangulation stations as terminals, as it was considered that these distances would provide the most accurate standard a mean scale factor was derived and applied to the "Kai Tak Coordinates" to give the final adopted "Tellurometer Coordinates".</p>
    <img class="contentRight" src="image/geodetic/HKM_N.jpg" />
    <p class="paragraph1"><font style="color:blue;text-decoration: underline;">Coordinate System</font>: In computing the new coordinates it was decided to adopt the same origin as before i.e. Victoria Peak close to Trig Victoria Peak No.1 which has a plane rectangular coordinate value of 5.18 ft N and 0.38 ft E. However to ensure that in future all coordinates would be Northings and Eastings the opportunity was taken at this stage to create a false origin by adding constant of 50000 ft and 120000 ft to the Northings and Eastings respectively. Thus in the New System Victoria Peak Trig has the coordinates 50005.18 ft N and 120000.38 ft E.</p>
    <p class="paragraph1">'New Imperial' coordinate system is used in that time. The Hong Kong (1963) Datum was established using Clarke(1858) as the reference ellipsoid and Partridge Hill a origin of the local Datum. A plane rectangular grid system was developed using 'Cassini projection' with grid origin in the southwest of Lantau Island to enable the co-ordinates in the Hong Kong territory were all positive values.</p>
    <br />
    
    <p class="subtitle">1976 Metrication</p>
	<p class="paragraph1">In line with the metrication policy in the 1970s, the Imperial grid was converted to metric unit of measure in 1975-1977 with the grid origin further shifted 3550m to the west.<font style="color:blue;font-weight:bold;">(i.e. Northing &#215; 0.3048, Easting &#215; 0.3048 - 3550 m in value)</font></p>
    <br />
    
    <p class="subtitle">1980 Trilateration</p>
	<p class="paragraph1">According to the 'Explanatory Notes on Geodetic Datums in Hong Kong', with the introduction of electromagnetic distance measuring (EDM) instruments, the distances between hilltop triangulation control points were resurveyed in 1978-1979 to improve the consistence and accuracy of the control network.</p>
	<p class="paragraph1">The observations were generally to a high standard:</p>
    <img class="contentRight" style="margin-bottom:50px;" src="image/geodetic/HKM_M.jpg" />
    <ul class="content">
		<li>A complete resurvey of the existing main trig network was to be carried out by trilateration methods, so as to achieve the highest practical accuracy.</li>
		<li>A minor trig observations of 1976 would be retained as the breakdown survey.</li>
		<li>Additional distance measurements would be taken over the minor trig network to strengthen the breakdown.</li>
		<li>The entire system would for the first time be computed on a true projection.</li>
		<li>The system would be introduced as the basis for the new coordinate system for Hong Kong.</li>
	</ul>
    <p class="paragraph1">In this re-survey, different datum and reference ellipsoid were adopted and called as HK80 geodetic datum (adding 800,000 m to both Nothing and Easting) and International Hayford 1910 reference ellipsoid. In the same time, Transverse Mercator projection as the rectangular grid system - the Hong Kong 1980 Grid - which currently used by any surveys.</p>
    <br />
    
    <p class="subtitle">GPS Refinement</p>
	<p class="paragraph1">In 1990, the Survey & Mapping Office (SMO) of Lands Department started to apply the Global Positioning System (GPS) technique for fixing position of survey control points. A territory wide observation on a network of 15 stations (13 of which are at existing triangulation stations) was carried out by the No. 512 Specialist Team, Royal Engineers of the UK Military Survey using GPS and Doppler satellite techniques. The network was adjusted with the results of high accuracy order. This survey provided a rigid link between the local HK80 Geodetic Datum and the global WGS84 Datum.</p>
    <br />
    
    <p class="subtitle">2000 GPS Network</p>
	<img class="contentLeft" src="image/geodetic/2000GPS.jpg" width="500" height="420" />
	<p class="paragraph1">In 2000, the GPS network was densified to tackle the drawback of the 1991 GPS network. (i.e. sparsely distributed and remote locations). A total of 46 stations were set up in the 2000 GPS network making the average distance between stations became 10km.</p>
