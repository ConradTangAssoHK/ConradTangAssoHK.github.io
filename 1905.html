    <br />
    
    <p class="subtitle">House Lot Block Crown Lease (or Village Block Crown Lease, VBCL)</p>
    <p class="paragraph1">Limited by the scale of DD sheets, large portions of the Old Scheduled House Lots (HL) were not individually surveyed in the DD survey, in particular, <font style="color:red;font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">the DD sheets at 1:3960 scale mainly in Yuen Long District</font>. Instead, they were depicted as hatched blocks annotated with village names only on the DD sheets. In fact, each of the HL was identified on ground and gone through the same adjudication process as the agricultural lots. A separate Schedule would contain all the HL for each village. The Schedules were then bound into the Village Block Crown Lease (VBCL) respectively for each DD. Usually the position for every village included in the VBCL will be annotated in the relevant DD map.</p>
    <br />
    
    <p class="subtitle">House Block Plan (HBP)</p>
    <a href="image/1905/09_HBP.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="contentRight" src="image/1905/09_HBP.jpg" width="300px" style="border:1px solid #000" /></a>
    <p class="paragraph1">Many village houses were shown on the DD sheets as cross-hatched blocks. The Government then intended to supplement the DD sheets by survey plans of the HL at a scale larger than the DD sheets. A House Block Survey was conducted in 1915 aiming to cover all un-surveyed house lots in the DD survey. House Block Plans (HBP) were produced at 1:600 scale. The details in the HBP were reasonably accurate and relative position among themselves was good but no reference control framework was introduced.</p>
    <p class="paragraph1">However, of unknown reasons, the House Block Survey was not completed. Some of them were lost in the War. Most importantly, these HBP were not legally reconciled with the schedule of the BCL through registration or legislation. In effect, these plans are only internal Government records.</p>
	<br />
    
    <p class="subtitle">New Grand Lots (NGL)</p>
    <p class="paragraph1">Subsequent to the DD survey, all unclaimed land was declared to be Crown Land and later selected areas were disposed of by public auction or direct sale as New Grant Lots (NGL). These NGL once granted were point out to new owners and roughly sketched on separate plans by staff without any survey training. The so-called grant plans were invariably at an extremely small scale with few, if any, details or reliable map references.</p>
    <p class="paragraph1">Land grants after the BCL were subject to the contemporary land administration practice. Developments thereon were governed by the prevailing general conditions as stipulated in relevant Government Notification (GN). Other than Grant/Lease Plans and Condition of <a href="image/1905/HLP.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="contentRight" src="image/1905/HLP.jpg" width="300px" style="border:1px solid #000; margin-right:0px;" /></a>Grants/Lease, the following may provide additional information about the NGL:</p>
    <ul class="content">
    	<li>Government Notification (GN) on the Sale of Land;</li>
    	<li>Colonial Secretary's Office (CSO) and Land Office Files (LO);</li>
    	<li>New Grant Register;&lt;br&gt;- Records marked in FAS, Schedule of BCL and DD Retrace.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="paragraph1">Ideally, the land boundaries should be clearly defined in the grant plan and a lease survey should be carried out after the occupation and building work to rectify anomalies due to construction works. <font style="color:blue;font-style:italic;">However the following is observed for new grant lot in the New Territories:</font></p>
    <p class="paragraph1">The standard of grant plans if exists varies. Some plans were drawn at a scale of 1:10000 or smaller with military grid reference. Some plans related the subject lot position to ground features such as a tree or stream course. Some plans depicted conflicting geometrical information and erroneous description. Therefore, the boundary information <a href="image/1905/DD_Control.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="contentRight" src="image/1905/DD_Control.jpg" width="300px" style="border:1px solid #000; margin-right:0px;" /></a>and the area of NGL could seldom be more accurate than the DD lots.</p>
    <p class="paragraph1">Some New Grant (NG) house lots were inserted onto small scale (1:3960) DD sheets for record. The true positions of many new grants were not properly recorded and some became missing lots by the propagation of time.</p>
    <p class="paragraph1">Grant documents including grant plans for many new grants before 1945 were destroyed in the War.</p>
    <p class="paragraph1">Since the late 1950&amp;#39;s grant plans were prepared in scale of 1:1200. However, some of the plans did not carry grid reference; many features have been changed, many positions were erroneously delineated.</p>
    <p class="paragraph1">Other than &quot;pointing out&quot;, it is believed that the NG lot boundaries had never been reliably set out on ground. Lease survey was never carried out for NT lots. Consequently, the development of many NG lots did not match with the original grant position.</p>
    <p class="paragraph1">The records of NGL should be recorded in DD Control Sheet. These plans give a fairly complete record of all OSL and those NGL which were granted before the appearance of the 100' (1 : 1200) survey sheet. Any lots resumed or surrendered will be recorded in a schedule on the DD Control Sheet (1:3960 &amp; 1:1980) concerned and the lots colored in yellow. Where subsequent divisions of the lots have been registered in District Land Office, the DD Control Sheets will also be kept up-to-date accordingly.</p>
    <p class="paragraph1">Many NGL were not recorded properly. Some records were marked randomly in HBP or duplicated copies of DD control. Some DD controls were lost due to office moving or casualty of war. Many NGL records were not available. If the land were not properly maintained and utilized, double and overlapping grants may result. Even after the availability of 1:1200 survey sheets, NGL were not recorded in a complete and comprehensive manner. In conclusion, the completeness and reliability of NGL positional records were doubtful.</p>
    <p class="paragraph1">Since 1950&amp;#39;s, some of the NG were dimensioned and set out on ground by the Crown Lands and Survey Office (CL&amp;SO) of the Public Works Department (PWD) as requested by the New Territories Administration (NTA), land authority in the NT. Owing to the prevailing land administration practice, the dimension plans were never properly registered to replace the grant plans nor any lease executed. The grant plan, prepared in DD scale and inscribed &quot;subject to survey&quot;, remains the only legal document for the land grant unless rectification is commissioned. It is noted that, when produced, survey plans were seldom challenged in the court of law.</p>
    <br />
    
    <p class="subtitle">Record Maintenance - Duplication, Addition and Deletion on DD Sheets</p>
			<p class="paragraph1">For land administration purposes, copies of the DD plans were used as an internal reference and records. Because of ageing and repeated use, the originals of the registered plans may have become dilapidated. DD Retraces were produced from time to time so as to provide plans of legible quality. Inevitably, addition, correction and deletions are inserted onto the internal records. The process of retrace, addition and deletion had been carried out with utmost care and were subject to various internal checking procedures. The variations should be found to be acceptable for their main use - identification. It must not deny that copying errors did exist by retracing. In general, the discrepancy should be within an acceptable tolerance. Therefore these DD Controls and Retraces should not be taken as the sole reference for a boundary definition of the land parcels.</p>
