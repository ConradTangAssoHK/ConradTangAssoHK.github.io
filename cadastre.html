	<p class="titleFont" style="font-style: italic;">Cadastre</p>
    <br />
	<p class="paragraph1">Hong Kong has enacted Land Registration Ordinance [Cap. 128] since 1844. It is a leasehold registration system. Boundary rights are described by  the plan attached to the registered document. A registered plan in a lease is the legal evidence of boundary, and the lease plan is a government  product with survey accuracy. For many land grants that the lease were not executed, the legal boundary would be referred to the previous status of land grant : land sale plan or draft lease plan. And, under common law jurisdiction, occupation, which is usually not conformal to the land grant, would gain legal status.</p>
	<p class="paragraph1">For the New Territories, The grant plan, Demarcation District Sheet, registered in a Block Crown Lease (Block Government Lease after 1997) is the legal boundary evidence in a precise sence (&quot;particularly delineated&quot;). These plans were survey products registered in 1905. The DD Sheet has generally an accuracy at meters level. They are not sufficient for precise determination of boundaries. The effects are like the General Boundary of UK such that the legal boundary are described by the boundary features. There is no fixed boundary law in Hong Kong. The re-establishment survey in Hong Kong is only legally recognised as the professional opinion of a land surveyor; not yet a legally determined lot boundary</p>
	<p class="paragraph1">In the Land Titles Ordinance [Cap 585], the lot boundaries determined under titles land are still <font style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">'Approximate Plot Boundary'</font>. In Section 18 (Boundaries), it states that:
    	<ol class="content" type="1">
        <li>For the purposes of this Ordinance, a plan referred to in the Title Register, shall be treated as only indicating:</li>
          <ol class="content" type="a">
            <li>the approximate situation</li>
            <li>the approximate boundaries</li>
          </ol>
        <li style="list-style-type:none;">of the registered land to which the plan relates.</li>
        <li value="2">For the avoidance of doubt, it is hereby declared that the fact that a plan ... shall not constitute a warranty as to the accuracy of the plan, or a guarantee, as to the accuracy of the plan.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    
    <p class="subtitle">Factors affecting Boundary Demarcation</p>
    <p class="paragraph1">Since Hong Kong adopts a leasehold boundary system without legal sanction of boundaries after the land grant,   boundary conflicts may exist when the boundaries are re-established. The following are several factors which may be causing the boundary conflicts:</p>
    <ol class="content" type="1">
    <li>Historical Factors</li>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;margin-left:15px;margin-top:5px;margin-bottom:5px;">Traditional Chinese Deeds Registration System
    	<Br />
        Before the colonization of Hong Kong, Qing Chinese government used the Deeds Registration system. It provided a means for registration of all instruments affecting real and immovable properties and all matters relating to land registration. It showed the land rights was highly dependent on the register of land more than land boundary. The Chinese had little awareness on the idea of fixing their land parcels' boundaries. Very often, only brief lot descriptions were depicted with the deeds without any absolute coordinates. In many cases, the physical features on ground was the land parcel boundary. However, "permanent" occupations may not last for long. The boundary then became untraceable if we believed  the boundary was the occupations.
    </li>
    <li value="2">Political Factors</li>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;margin-left:15px;margin-top:5px;margin-bottom:5px;">Colonial Policies
    	<br />
        The British government did not expect an eternal interest in early Hong Kong. It was not surprised that less motivation to develop permanent and highly systematical cadastral system by themselves. Protection of the land rights for owners remained a low priority in cadastral policy.
    </li>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;margin-left:15px;margin-top:5px;margin-bottom:5px;">The Purpose of Cadastral Survey in Early Hong Kong
        <br />
        The first and second demarcation district surveys (D.D. Survey) in New Territories were the large-scale Cadastral surveys in Hong Kong history. The 'ultimate' purpose to carry out these surveys was for land tax collection. The New Territories were surveyed and 1:3960 and 1:1980 scale demarcation districts sheets were drawn by Indian surveyors in 1889 and 1901 respectively. The area of land parcels was recorded in the Block Crown Lease Schedule representing how much annual rent payable instead of dimensional units. Information including name of owner, type of land and annual rent payable were recorded in Block Crown Lease, an important textual land record which we referred to.
    </li>
    <li value="3">Political Factors</li>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;margin-left:15px;margin-top:5px;margin-bottom:5px;">Different Land Records
    	<br />
        Due to various problems and causes, conflicts between different land records on the subject or adjacent land parcels occurred occasionally. For examples, there were two piece of land parcels registered as "ten cents" in the Block Crown Lease, but the area graphically shown on the D.D. sheet may not be converted to the same. Some cases are the land A and land B registered in same rent with same land use (e.g. House) but area of land A was much larger than that of land B. This may be caused by survey and record mistakes, or other unexpected reasons.
    </li>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;margin-left:15px;margin-top:5px;margin-bottom:5px;">Old Record and Survey Methods
    	<br />
    	In the DD survey, a primitive method of plane tabling was carried out throughout this extensive survey. It is hardly to find any grid reference on the map sheet, the result was recorded and drafted by hand graphically. As compared with modern survey, this survey would not be better than nowadays.
    </li>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;margin-left:15px;margin-top:5px;margin-bottom:5px;">Followed UK practices, the re-establishment of a lot boundary is subject to the best available evidence. However, different surveyors may have different ideas adopting the best available evidence.
    	<br />
        Apart of the low accuracy surveying, the record method was also unreliable for long term reference. Some of the original D.D. sheets kept in District Survey Offices were in unsatisfactory condition. However, related (digitized) D.D. old records always became one of the important land boundary evidences nowadays. At the same time, errors may be generated during correlation.
