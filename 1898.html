	<p class="titleFont" style="font-style:italic;">Demarcation District Survey</p>
    <br />
    
    <p class="paragraph1">A collective survey was carried out, from November 1898 to April 1904, originally to serve for a fiscal survey to assist in the urgent preparation of the Crown Rent Roll once China had granted the lease to Britain of that area now known as the New Territories (NT). A cardinal principle within any fiscal survey is that the Rent Rolls:</p>
    <ul class="content">
    	<li>Be compiled within the minimal period of time; and</li>
    	<li>The fiscal survey, upon which the Rent Rolls depend, be such as to embrace all existing occupations.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="paragraph1">This, to some extent, explains the methods and procedures to prepare the Crown Rent Rolls and ownership identification. The DD survey tended to perform the duties of a register of presumptive title to land. The record of title, which was originally designed to meet fiscal requirements, subsequently acquired a value in clarifying private rights and in giving a sense of security to right-holders.</p>
    <br />
    
    <p class="subtitle">The First New Territories Land Registration - Demarcation District (DD) Survey</p>
	<a href="image/1898/01_DLS.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="contentRight" src="image/1898/01_DLS.jpg" width="300px" style="border:1px solid #000" /></a>
    <p class="paragraph1">Immediately after the confirmation of the Peking Convention 1898, the New Territories was declared by an Order in Council to be part of the Colony of Hong Kong, but to be administered separately from the urban areas. At the same time, the Hong Kong Government began the DD survey.</p>
    <p class="paragraph1">A survey team, led by Tate and Newland, was seconded from the Survey of India to provide survey control and survey the New Territories. The control survey, a topographical survey at a scale of 1:63360 and a fiscal survey of all occupied land were carried out simultaneously. The bulk of the fiscal survey was completed by July 1904 and the control survey was finished a year later.</p>
    <p class="paragraph1">The whole territory including outlying islands and the New Kowloon (or Survey Districts in New Kowloon, SD) was divided into Demarcation Districts of convenient size for plotting on individual sheets, with an area of about 200 acres each. As revealed from the original field sheets, DD survey was principally conducted by plane table method using hand chains. The survey of each DD was to be controlled by a framework of traverse. However, there was no known grids for DD sheets or a territorial control network, each area was individually oriented on Magnetic North.</p>
    <p class="paragraph1">The Demarcation District sheets (DD sheets) were basically detailed maps of agricultural and village house land uses produced from 1899 to 1904. The land parcel boundaries are the position of features such as field bunds, walls and fences. The surveyors found that the size of the cultivation in the NT were too small for the original scale of 1:3960 (16 inches to one mile). Later, the scale of survey drawings was expended to 1:1980 (32 inches to one mile). <a href="image/1898/02_FAS.bmp" target="_blank"><img class="contentRight" src="image/1898/02_FAS.bmp" width="300px" style="margin-right:0px; border:1px solid #000" /></a>Totally 477 DD Sheets had been allocated. Double Lot Sheets (DLS) were the first generation DD sheets with field numbers depicted in black and lot number depicted in red. By 1902, staff from the Survey Department of India completed the Field Area Statement (FAS) books by estimating the lot area from the DD sheets in the office in non-field days. A total of 85 DD/SD sheets plotted at 1:3960 scale and 471 sheets at 1:1980 were produced.</p>
    
    <p class="paragraph1">The DD sheets showed individual lot boundaries but without any map reference to facilitate locating of them on the ground. As no control points survived today, we can hardly assess its positional accuracy directly. Since the relative accuracy attainable by DD sheet are constrained by the scale, in general dimensional uncertainty of two to three meters would be expected. Up to now, there is no general assessment about the accuracy of DD sheets in the NT.</p>
    <p class="paragraph1">The DD sheets were fairly representative of the ground features in open area. However, the accuracy fell off in remote and built up areas. Large errors are observed:</p>
    <ul class="content">
    	<li>Orientation of land parcels to have shifted 90 degrees;</li>
    	<li>Positional shifts over ten meters;</li>
    	<li>Coastline, stream courses and houses obscured by other development are typical blunder prone areas.</li>
    </ul>
    <br /><br />
    <p class="subtitle">Title Claim, Demarcation and Adjudication</p>
    <p class="paragraph1">A Land Court was set up. The villagers started to claim the paddies marked on field. The claimants have to produce evidence of title including deed of transaction. Some of these documents were registered under Chinese officials, <a href="image/1898/06_Indenture_DD.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="contentRight" src="image/1898/06_Indenture_DD.jpg" width="300px" style="border:1px solid #000; margin-right:0px;" /></a>the "red deeds" having a red chop as against the unregistered "white deeds". Nevertheless the Chinese registration system was not complete, systematic or comprehensive:</p>
    <ul class="content">
    	<li>Various units were employed for land transaction in the Qing dynasty. The most common unit for cultivation field was "mou". Another common unit for paddy fields, "Tau Chung" was linked with the reproductive capacity of the land, and thus was of varying size according to the quality of the land.</li>
    	<li>It was also a common phenomenon for landowners to understate the areas of their land holdings so as to attract less land rent. On the other hand, the tenant would extend as much wasteland as they could.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="paragraph1">There was no index map in the land registration records kept by officials of the Chinese Government.</p>
    <br />
    
    <p class="subtitle">The Block Government Lease (former Block Crown Lease, BCL)</p>
    <p class="paragraph1">The area in the Field Area Statement (FAS) was then copied to the Schedule of the Block Crown Lease (BCL) and became the Registered Area. Lots within the same DD sheet were recorded collectively under a common lease called the Block Crown Lease, now called Block Lease after 1997 and the lots were known as Old Scheduled Lots (OSL). These are the only legal records of all OSL in the NT. By 1st August 1905 enacting the New Territories Land Ordinance, BCL for most DD were compiled and became<a href="image/1898/06_Schedule.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="contentRight" src="image/1898/06_Schedule.jpg" width="300px" style="border:1px solid #000; margin-right:0px;" /></a> the legal document setting out the terms and conditions of lease. Leases were for 75 years from 1st July 1898 renewable at a reassessed Crown Rent, for a further period of 24 years less the last three days. Many of the BCLs were signed by the Governor Sir Nathan in 1905 while some BCLs were signed by Governor May in 1907.</p>
    <p class="paragraph1">Each BCL was divided into 3 parts: the Indenture, the Schedule and the plan (DD Sheet). The indenture of the BCL stated that a piece of land parcel is "more particularly delineated and described on the Plan". The Schedule of the BCL contains all lots owned by each individual owner including the Address of the owner, the Status (area and class) and Annual Crown Rent payable for the lots.</p>
    <p class="paragraph1">The annual rent for agricultural lots was classified into 1st (usually denoted as padi), 2nd (dry and vegetable cultivation) and 3rd (waste, fallow, threshing floor, orchard, courtyard, pond, wetland, stream course, embankment, and footpath etc.) at the rate of $3, $2 and $1 per acre respectively. Similarly the annual rent for building and house lots was classified into 1st, 2nd and 3rd (shed, pigsty, latrine etc) attracting the rate of $1, $0.5 and $0.25.</p>
    <p class="paragraph1">The smallest unit of area of lots registered in the BCL is 0.01 acre (by conversion of 435.6 square feet or 40.46 square meter). Hence, the accuracy in area depended on the accuracy achievable by the survey method, scale of DD drawing and area estimation method.</p>
