    <p class="subtitle">Background Information</p>
    <a href="image/1841/1870Map.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="contentRight" src="image/1841/1870Map.jpg" width="200px" style="border:1px solid #000;" /></a>
	<p class="paragraph1">As far back as the Qin (秦) (<i>221-206 B.C.</i>) and Han (漢) (<i>206 B.C. - 220 A.D.</i>) dynasties, the Chinese Government already exercised effective administrative control over Hong Kong, which was successively placed under the jurisdiction of the counties of Panyu (番禺縣), Bao'an (寶安縣), Dongguan (東莞縣) and Xin'an (新安縣). During the Yuan (元) (<i>1271 - 1368</i>), Ming (明) (<i>1368 - 1644</i>) and Qing (清) (<i>1644 - 1911</i>) dynasties, the government set up the sub-districts of Tuen Mun and Kuan Fu there, indicating that the central authorities tightening control over the region.</p>
	<p class="paragraph1">Chinese inhabitants had built villages and towns of various sizes on that island, in Kowloon and on the vast tracts of land later known as the " New Territories". There they engaged in farming, fishing, salt refining, navigation or shop keeping, ran schools, built temples, and led a peaceful, tranquil and self-sufficient life; their customs and habits showed a striking similarity to those in the coastal areas of Fujian and Guangdong provinces.</p>
    <br /><br /><br />
    
    <p class="subtitle">Colony of Hong Kong</p>
    <p class="paragraph1">The Colony of Hong Kong was born in the early Victorian era as a military, commercial and administrative centre for the expanding British trade with China. In the 1830's, in order to fortify their opium trade with China, the British merchants were eager to seek a safe trading port, both politically and geographically. Hong Kong was the ideal site for such an administrative centre. The Canton Register, a newspaper with a circulation among the foreign community of Guangzhou and Macao, in 25 April 1836, stated that:</p>
    <p class="paragraph1" style="margin-left:135px; margin-right:135px; margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:10px;">If the lion's paw is to be put down on any part of the south side of China, let it be Hong Kong: let the lion declare it to be under his guarantee a free port, and in ten years it will be the most considerable mart east of the Cape. The Portuguese made a mistake; they adopted shallow water and exclusive rules. Hong Kong, deep water, and a free port forever! <font color="#0080FF"><b>[Cameron, 1991]</b></font></p>

    <p class="subtitle">Annexation of Hong Kong Island</p>
    <a href="image/1841/Nanking.jpg"><img class="contentRight" src="image/1841/Nanking.jpg" width="300px" style="border:1px solid #000;" /></a>
    <p class="paragraph1">On the 26th January 1841, Caption Charles Elliot hoisted the flag at Possession Point and proclaimed Hong Kong a British Colony. It was not until June the 26th 1843, however that this was confirmed by the ratification of the <font color="red"><b><i><u>Treaty of Nanking</u></i></b></font>. Article 3 of the Treaty stipulated the cession of Hong Kong Island to Britain.</p>
    <p class="paragraph1">During the first few weeks of settlement, Caption Belcher of H.M.S. Sulphur mapped the coastline and calculated the heights of the ore prominent peaks on Hong Kong Island. The earliest plots of land were purchased from the local Chinese without proper enquiry into title by the purchasers and building commenced without reference to authority.</p>
    <p class="paragraph1">In May 1841, it was decided that all land would be sold by public auction and the first lots were marked out, each with a 100 feet frontage along Queen's Road and varying lengths to the winding coastline. It is recorded that difficulties were encountered with the survey, thus only 50 lots were completed and it was later found that the lots were inaccurately mark out. Boundary problems have existed ever since the outset of the colony as no boundary right was intended.</p>
    <p class="paragraph1">The first land sale was run in Macao, June 1841 <font color="#0080FF"><b>[Nissim, 1998]</b></font>. Elliot promised to provide perpetual titles to the merchants who bid for the very first land parcels in Hong Kong, but later this promise was rejected by London.</p>
    <p class="paragraph1">After the official signing of Treaty of Nanking in June 1843, the Hong Kong Government was established under the Royal Charter. The first Legislative and Executive councils were also created. All the land in Hong Kong was held under a leasehold basis. The terms of the tenure varied from old lease of 999 years to modern lease of 75 years with the right of renewal.</p>
    <br />
    
    <p class="subtitle">Introduction of Deeds Registration System</p>
    <p class="paragraph1">The Land Registration Ordinance (Cap 128) has been enacted since 1844. It is an efficient system to facilitate conveyance in the expense of less title security as well as boundary security. It set up a means for registration of all instruments affecting real and immovable property and all matters relating to land registration. However, the registration was only effective for recording land transaction, the legal result of the transaction was not proven.</p>
    <p class="paragraph1">In the registration system, a deed register was established in which all deeds affecting interests in land were registered. The deeds were being kept for all transactions of land.</p>
    <br />
    
    <p class="subtitle">Annexation of Kowloon Peninsula</p>
    <a href="image/1841/Peking.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="contentRight" src="image/1841/Peking.jpg" width="300px" style="border:1px solid #000;" /></a>
	<p class="paragraph1">On 18th and 19th of October, 1860, the Anglo-French forces took the Andingmen (安定門) Gate of Peking (Beijing) and guns they emplaced on the city wall were trained directly at the heart of the Qing court - the Forbidden City. Under the military and diplomatic pressure of aggressors, the Qing court was forced to sign in the <font color="red"><b><i><u>Convention of Peking</u></i></b></font>. It was stipulated in Article 6 of the convention that China should cede to British a part of Kowloon Peninsula lying south of present Boundary Street to the Northernmost point of Stonecutter's Island (昂船州).
    <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
    
    <p class="subtitle">Leasing of the New Territories</p>
    <a href="image/1841/HK_Extension.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="contentRight" src="image/1841/HK_Extension.jpg" width="300px" style="border:1px solid #000;" /></a>
    <p class="paragraph1">On June 9, 1898, the Convention between the United Kingdom and China on the <font color="red"><b><i><u>Extension of Hong Kong Territory</u></i></b></font> was signed in Peking (Beijing). Through the convention, which went into effect on July 1 of that year, Britain forcibly secured a 99-year lease of the large areas north of the present Boundary Street and south of the shortest line between Starling Inlet and Deep Bay, 235 nearby islands of various sizes as well as the sea areas of Mirs Bay (大鵬灣) and Deep Bay (深灣). The lease increased the land area under British occupation by 975.1 sq. km. or about 12 times the original administrative area of Hong Kong, while the sea areas under British occupation increased 40- to 50- fold. These land and sea areas leased from China were later called the New Territories of Hong Kong.</p>

    <p class="subtitle">Early Colonial Surveys</p>
    <a href="image/1841/inlandlot118.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="contentRight" src="image/1841/inlandlot118.jpg" width="300px" style="border:1px solid #000;" /></a>
    <p class="paragraph1">As mentioned by <font color="#0080FF"><b>[Cameron, 1991, p.34]</b></font>, the first land auction program had the intention of providing one hundred marine lots along the seaward side of Queen&#39;s Road and a further one hundred suburban lots along the landward side. Because of the difficult terrain and limited time, there were only 50 lots completed with survey, each lot having 100 feet of frontage along Queen&#39;s Road with varying lengths to the coastline. For those lands were auctioned, there were deficiencies in the setting out, as well as the recording of the surveys. Because no boundary right was originally intended, boundary problems have existed ever since the beginning of the colony.</p>
    <p class="paragraph1">The boundaries and the area of each lot, usually rectangular in shape, were described in the text of the lease and the attached lease plan. Many old survey plans still can be found with the first alienation deeds. Additionally, many old boundary stones are still traceable on the site as well as in the record. In this oldest part of Hong Kong Island, occupation and land grants have changed several times during the last one hundred and fifty years. Occasionally, when it is necessary to consult old land grant documents and plans in order to define the legal dimension of the land, problems and even court disputes may arise.</p>
    <p class="paragraph1">Commercial lots along the waterline of the Central District were designated as Marine Lots. While lots, 200 feet landward, were designated Inland Lots, used primarily for residential purpose. Early grant plans showed the distances and the area of the subject lot in an &#34;island map&#34; style. Figure 1  <img class="contentRight" src="image/1841/ALbuildinglot312.gif" width="300px" style="border:1px solid #000; margin-right:0px;" />shows an example of this &#34;island map&#34;. Expensive residential areas were found in the mid-levels and the Victoria Peak areas. A sample of a grant plan of a Rural Building Lot is given as Figure 2. The plan shows the general shape of the lot, distances and total area. Similarly, no coordinates were provided.</p>
    <p class="paragraph1">At the outset of every colony, the surveyor general was a powerful figure. Usually he was a military officer and in-charge of land settlement, land grants and all other engineering projects. Between the 1840&#39;s and 1880&#39;s, the Surveyor General&#39;s Department carried out land sales, survey, land registration and all engineering operations in the Colony. Gradually, following the development of the region, the surveyor general&#39;s role evolved and separated into various professional areas, such as land management, valuation, engineering and so on. In 1891, with the formation of the Public Works Department, the Director of Public Works replaced the post of Surveyor General in Hong Kong. The Superintendent of the Survey Office incharged the survey service. By 1901, the Surveyor&#39;s Office was changed to the Crown Lands and Survey Office which lasted till the formation of Lands Department in 1982.</p>
